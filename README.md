Cooperator: Always cooperates.  
Defector: Always defects.    
TitForTat: Starts with cooperation, then mirrors the opponent's last move.  
Grudger: Cooperates initially, but defects permanently if the opponent ever defects.  
Prober: Attempts to exploit the opponent by defecting, then adjusts.  
RandomStrategy: Makes random moves.  
Pavlov: Repeats its last move if it resulted in a "success" (both cooperated or both defected); otherwise, changes its move.  
SoftMajority: Cooperates as long as opponent cooperations outnumber or equal defections.  
HardMajority: Cooperates only if opponent cooperations strictly outnumber defections.  
TitForTwoTats: Cooperates, but defects only if the opponent defects twice consecutively.
